# Introduction

In this repository we release the code and data for our paper "sat2pc: Generating Building Roof's Point Cloud from a Single 2D Satellite Images" in ICCPS 2023. You can find the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12464).

# Installation

To use this repository you need an environemnt with python 3.7.9. We suggests creating a conda environment with the following command:

```
conda create -n "sat2pc" python=3.7.9
```

Next, activate the environemnt and cd to the direcotry of the downloaded repository then run the following command:

```
python create_conda_environemt.py
```

This command will install the required packages.

# Data

The dataset from the paper can be dowloaded from [here](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yor10_pitt_edu/Eo4HLZ9ysERBkBem0wl5HZ8BBcqzDruuI77PhfqL_kWIWg).

# Usage

To train the model you can run the following command:

```
python train.py --config ./configs/sat2pc.gin --data-dir ./datasets/
```

To test the model you can run the following command:

```
python test.py --config ./configs/sat2pc.gin --data-dir ./datasets/ --ckpt-path [location of the saved weights]
```

# Visualization

To visualize the predictions from the model you can use the following command:

```
python visualize.py --data-dir ./datasets --results [location of the .res file generated by running the test script]
```
